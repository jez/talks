    <p>One of my favorite quotes is this one by Manuel Blum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are all computer scientists.<br> You know what FINITE AUTOMATA can do.<br> You know what TURING MACHINES can do.<br> For example, Finite Automata can add but not multiply.<br> Turing Machines can compute any computable function.<br> Turing machines are incredibly more powerful than Finite Automata.<br> Yet the only difference between a FA and a TM is that<br> the TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil.<br> Think about it.<br> It tells you something about the power of writing.<br> Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.<br> With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.</p>
<p>— Manuel Blum, <em>Advice to a Beginning Graduate Student</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing is a critically important skill for various reasons. Once you’ve convinced yourself <em>to write</em>, the next question becomes <em>how to write</em>. Writing at the Command Line introduces a handful of workflows, tools, and suggestions for writing in plain text, with a particular emphasis on Markdown.</p>
