Vim as an IDE is an interactive workshop-style tech talk that I first gave at
Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the Computer Club Talk Series. Its
central motivation is this: students who have been instructed or told to use Vim
to complete programming assignments while ssh'ed are missing out on the vast
power that lies within Vim.

There are two fronts to having an amazing Vim experience:

- knowing how to manipulate text using Vim's built in keyboard shortcuts
- having plugins that make Vim behave like users would expect from a modern text
  editor.

In my experience as a TA and fellow student, learning the former requires the
latter and vice versa, leading to a vicious cycle of Vim peril. With this in
mind, this talk aims to cure the latter, so that the vicious cycle can
end.

One of my favorite parts of this talk is that it uses commits and the GitHub
interface to show participants the diff of exactly what changed alongside a
description of how to complete the step.
