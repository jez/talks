title: "State of Sorbet: A Type Checker for Ruby"
date: "2019-04-19"
---

At [Stripe](https://jez.io/thoughts/on-stripe/) I've been working on
[Sorbet](https://sorbet.org), a type checker for Ruby. Along with Paul Tarjan, I
presented a progress update at RubyKaigi 2019 in Fukuoka, Japan about what we
worked on in 2018 and what we'd be working on in 2019.

The talk breaks down into a couple of sections:

- A brief description of Stripe and what we work on
- The process of adopting Sorbet at Stripe
- The editor tools that we've built on top of Sorbet
- Our plan for what Sorbet will look like when open sourced

The abstract of the talk:

> We have developed a type system for Ruby at Stripe with a goal of helping
> developers understand code better, write code with more confidence, and
> detect & prevent significant classes of bugs.
>
> This talk shares experience of Stripe successfully adopting Sorbet in our
> codebase which had millions lines of code that were written before the
> typechecker had been conceived. The talk will describe:
>
> - the process used to add typing to existing code;
> - many tools developed to support this process;
> - impact of this type system on safety and productivity at Stripe.
>
> We also have some exciting announcements!
>
> The talk does not require any previous knowledge of types and should be
> accessible to a broad audience.
>
> <p></p>

A definite plus of giving this talk was getting to travel to Japan in April!
