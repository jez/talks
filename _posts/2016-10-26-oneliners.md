Learning to write bash oneliners is skill that pays incredible dividends over
the course of career in software engineering or computer science. While
individual oneliners usually tend to take on a life of their own, a few
principles apply to nearly every oneliner.

I gave this talk at CMU as a part of the course 15-131 Great Practical Ideas for
Computer Scientists. Since it was for a lecture, it splits its time beteween
reviewing old material and introducing new material. Topics introduced include
shell IO redirection, crafting bash oneliners iteratively, and some common tools
that compose well in oneliners.
