One of my favorite quotes is this one by Manuel Blum:

> You are all computer scientists.<br>
> You know what FINITE AUTOMATA can do.<br>
> You know what TURING MACHINES can do.<br>
> For example, Finite Automata can add but not multiply.<br>
> Turing Machines can compute any computable function.<br>
> Turing machines are incredibly more powerful than Finite Automata.<br>
> Yet the only difference between a FA and a TM is that<br>
> the TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil.<br>
> Think about it.<br>
> It tells you something about the power of writing.<br>
> Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.<br>
> With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.

> â€” Manuel Blum, _Advice to a Beginning Graduate Student_

Writing is a critically important skill for various reasons. Once you've
convinced yourself *to write*, the next question becomes *how to write*. Writing
at the Command Line introduces a handful of workflows, tools, and suggestions
for writing in plain text, with a particular emphasis on Markdown.
