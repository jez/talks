I joined the hosts of [the Changelog podcast](https://changelog.com/) to talk
about working on Sorbet at Stripe.

The episode summary:

> This week we’re talking about type checking with Jake Zimmerman. Jake is one
> of the leads at Stripe working on Sorbet — an open source project that does
> Type checking in Ruby and runs over Stripe’s entire Ruby codebase. As of May
> of 2022 Stripe’s codebase was over 15 million lines of code spread across
> 150,000 files. If you think you have a bigger Ruby codebase, Jake is down to
> go byte-for-byte to see who wins. Jake shares tons of wisdom and more
> importantly he shares why he thinks types will win in the end.
