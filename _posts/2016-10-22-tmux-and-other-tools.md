This informal tech talk demos some of my favorite interactive command line
programs. I gave it as a part of the course 15-131 Great Practical Ideas for
Computer Scientists at CMU.

In particular, we explore package managers, `tmux`, `fzf`, and `ag`. These
programs blew my mind the first time I discovered them, and I enjoy being able
to share them with others.
