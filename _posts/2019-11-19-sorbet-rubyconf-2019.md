At [Stripe](https://jez.io/thoughts/on-stripe/) I've been working on
[Sorbet](https://sorbet.org), a type checker for Ruby. Along with Dmitry
Petrashko, I spoke about Sorbet at RubyConf 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee.

The abstract of the talk:

> In June we open-sourced Sorbet, a fast, powerful type checker designed for
> Ruby. In the 6 months since, tons of things have improved! We’ve built quality
> editor tools like jump-to-def and seen many contributions from a growing
> community. Within Stripe, we've used Sorbet to drive code quality via
> measurable, concrete indicators.
>
> We’ll share these improvements and give an update on our collaboration with
> Matz and the Ruby 3 Types working group. Suitable for anyone using Ruby—no
> familiarity with Sorbet needed! Come follow in the footsteps of the many
> companies already using Sorbet.
>
