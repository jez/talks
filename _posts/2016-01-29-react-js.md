At CMU, I was a part of a student organization called ScottyLabs. Among lots of
other things, the thing we were most well-known for was as the group that put on
TartanHacks, a collegiate hackathon open to CMU students in early February.

To provide the best possible experience for participants at TartanHacks, we
would run a number of events throughout the year to help them learn skills that
are useful at hackathons. In particular, at one called [Crash Course] I gave a
talk to introduce participants to the essentials of React.js.
