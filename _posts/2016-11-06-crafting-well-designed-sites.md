My interests varied wildly over my tenure at CMU. Towards the end of my time
there, I became increasingly interested in design, specifically typography and
information hierarchy. As such, for the Fall 2016 Web Dev Weekend (see also:
[Frontend JavaScript Primer]), I held another workshop-style talk on using
typography and information hierarchy titled "Crafting Well-Designed Sites."

It was split into two halves: a lecture portion where I introduced actionable
rules for improving the design of print and digital text, followed by an
interactive "design critique" where the participants sketched their ideas and we
discussed what we liked and didn't like about various designs.
