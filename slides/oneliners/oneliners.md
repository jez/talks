# Review

## We can define variables in bash

```zsh
# set my_variable to the string "hello"
# (no spaces around the '=')
$ my_variable="hello"

# get the value of my_variable and print it
$ echo $my_variable
hello

# print another_var surrounded by other text
$ another_var="some string"
$ echo lone${another_var}s
lonesome strings

# Sometimes using {...} is important:
$ echo lone$another_vars
lone
```

## Quotes can be used to group arguments

- No quotes
    - spaces separate arguments
- Single or double quotes
    - entire quoted argument is one argument
    - spaces inside don't break it up

## Quotes are optional sometimes

```zsh
# Unquoted strings are still strings
$ echo hello
hello

# Quoted strings are strings
$ echo 'hello'
hello
```

## Quotes aren't optional with special characters

```zsh
# Unquoted special characters are shell expanded
$ echo *
file1.txt folder

# Quoted special characters aren't expanded
$ echo "*"
*

# ...unless the special character is a '$'
$ echo "$my_variable"
hello

# ...in which case we can use single quotes
$ echo '$my_variable'
$my_variable
```

## We don't *have* to quote; we can escape

```zsh
# We can use '\' to escape special characters
$ echo \*
*

# Escaping and quoting compound on each other
# (Sometimes this is what we want)
$ echo "\*"
\*
```

## Understand the difference between globs and regex

```zsh
grep homework_problem(.*) homework.py
#                      ^
# This is a special shell character!
# We need to quote or escape it.

grep 'homework_problem(.*)' homework.py
#                       ^
# It's quoted now--we're good.
```

# Input & Output

## `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`

- Each process...
    - can listen for text input on `stdin` (standard input)
    - can output "normal" text on `stdout` (standard output)
    - can output "error" text on `stderr` (standard error)

## Redirection

- Normally `stdin` is the keyboard, and `stdout` & `stderr` are the terminal
- We can change this
    - We Have The Technologyâ„¢

| Syntax                 | Meaning                                                                |
| ------                 | -------                                                                |
| `command < file.txt`   | `stdin` from `file.txt` |
| `command > file.txt`   | `stdout` to `file.txt` (overwrite) |
| `command >> file.txt`  | `stdout` to `file.txt` (append) |
| `command 2> file.txt`  | `stderr` to `file.txt` (overwrite) |
| `command 2>> file.txt` | `stderr` to `file.txt` (append) |

## `/dev/null` is a "black hole" file

- Anything sent to `/dev/null` is thrown away
- Anything read from `/dev/null` is empty

## Pipes send `stdout` of one command to `stdin` of another

```zsh
# Disclaimer: this is a toy example.

# We normally run grep like this:
grep TODO *

# But if we give grep no arguments, it
# will search on stdin. So we can do
# this equivalent command
cat * | grep TODO
```

# Oneliners

## Oneliners are chains of pipes

- We start with some sort of data
- Then we filter it down

```zsh
# Example
$ du -h d1 | sort -hr
# ^          ^
# |          |
# |          `- And feed it to this command (filter)
# `- Take the stdout of this command (initial data)
```

## Useful commands

- Old:
    - `sed`
    - `grep`
- New:
    - `find`
        - `-name`
        - `-regex`
    - `curl`
    - `xargs`

## Examples

```zsh
# Open all PDF files not named written.pdf
find . -name "*pdf" \
  | grep -v "written.pdf" \
  | xargs open

# Get 100 random lowercase dictionary words
shuf /usr/share/dict/words \
  | head -n 100 \
  | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' \
  | sort

# Count how many times it says "Vim" on a page
curl https://jez.io \
  | grep --only-matching Vim \
  | wc -l
```

# Recap

## Tips for Writing Oneliners

- Construct oneliners iteratively!
    - Try the first command, see what it outputs
    - Try the first two commands, see what they output
    - ...
- Many tools do the same thing
    - Choose what you're familiar with
- Some tools are subtly different
    - For example, not all commands have the same regex syntax

## More resources

- Google is great for finding the *filtering* commands
    - "Strings that don't match..."
    - "Sum a list of numbers"
    - "Replace character with newline"
- ... but don't just run what people tell you!
    - `man` pages
