    <p>Vim as an IDE is an interactive workshop-style tech talk that I first gave at Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the Computer Club Talk Series. Its central motivation is this: students who have been instructed or told to use Vim to complete programming assignments while ssh’ed are missing out on the vast power that lies within Vim.</p>
<p>There are two fronts to having an amazing Vim experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>knowing how to manipulate text using Vim’s built in keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>having plugins that make Vim behave like users would expect from a modern text editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience as a TA and fellow student, learning the former requires the latter and vice versa, leading to a vicious cycle of Vim peril. With this in mind, this talk aims to cure the latter, so that the vicious cycle can end.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">Workshop (GitHub)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One of my favorite parts of this talk is that it uses commits and the GitHub interface to show participants the diff of exactly what changed alongside a description of how to complete the step.</p>
