    <p>I gave a talk at the SF Bay Area Ruby Meetup in April 2025 about the
history of Sorbet’s type syntax. The abstract of the talk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one loves Sorbet’s type syntax, but it’s still the only way to
annotate types alongside Ruby source code (comments not included). By
contrast, RBS annotations live in separate files, making them difficult
to use for anyone enthusiastic to adopt type—people turn to Sorbet
largely in spite of its syntax.</p>
<p>Why does <code>sig</code> take a block? Why do some types use
<code>T::</code> and some types use <code>T.</code>? Why do Sorbet type
annotations feel so verbose? How did it end up like this?</p>
<p>We’ll answer these questions and more. Starting from before Sorbet
existed, we’ll proceed through the history and circumstances which
influenced Sorbet’s type syntax, discussing the principles guiding the
design. We’ll end with some ideas for the future, both for Sorbet and
the wider typed Ruby ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the audio quality in the recording below is
particularly poor. If you happen to work at Stripe, I gave this same
talk as an internal “lunch and learn” tech talk that you should be able
to find from the internal Tech Talks page, which has better audio
quality.</p>
<p>I also turned my script for the talk into a blog post:</p>
<p>→ <a href="https://blog.jez.io/history-of-sorbet-syntax/">Past,
Present, and Future of Sorbet Type Syntax</a></p>
<p>Otherwise, I hope to be able to re-present this talk to get something
with better production quality. If you’d like me to present this talk at
your event, please reach out.</p>
