# talks

I've been lucky enough to have given a number of talks on subjects I care about.
This site acts as a repository of the talk descriptions and slides in the hopes
that they might be useful.

## Theme

This site uses the [Tufte Pandoc Jekyll] theme, which combines tufte-css with
Pandoc Markdown (including support for tufte-css-style sidenotes!).
