Towards the end of my time there, I became increasingly interested in design, specifically typography and information hierarchy. As such, for the Fall 2016 Web Dev Weekend (see also: &lt;a href=&quot;/talks//frontend-javascript-primer/&quot;&gt;Frontend JavaScript Primer&lt;/a&gt;), I held another workshop-style talk on using typography and information hierarchy titled “Crafting Well-Designed Sites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was split into two halves: a lecture portion where I introduced actionable rules for improving the design of print and digital text, followed by an interactive “design critique” where the participants sketched their ideas and we discussed what we liked and didn’t like about various designs.&lt;/p&gt;

Among lots of other things, the thing we were most well-known for was as the group that put on TartanHacks, a collegiate hackathon open to CMU students in early February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide the best possible experience for participants at TartanHacks, we would run a number of events throughout the year to help them learn skills that are useful at hackathons. In particular, at one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tartanhacks.com/crashcourse/&quot;&gt;Crash Course&lt;/a&gt; I gave a talk to introduce participants to the essentials of React.js.&lt;/p&gt;

Its central motivation is this: students who have been instructed or told to use Vim to complete programming assignments while ssh’ed are missing out on the vast power that lies within Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two fronts to having an amazing Vim experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowing how to manipulate text using Vim’s built in keyboard shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having plugins that make Vim behave like users would expect from a modern text editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience as a TA and fellow student, learning the former requires the latter and vice versa, leading to a vicious cycle of Vim peril. With this in mind, this talk aims to cure the latter, so that the vicious cycle can end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitting in with that theme, the Frontend JavaScript Primer talk taught students how to write JavaScript using jQuery by building an interactive, tile-based game.&lt;/p&gt;
