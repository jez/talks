Along with Dmitry Petrashko, I spoke about Sorbet at RubyConf 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract of the talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June we open-sourced Sorbet, a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby. In the 6 months since, tons of things have improved! We’ve built quality editor tools like jump-to-def and seen many contributions from a growing community. Within Stripe, we’ve used Sorbet to drive code quality via measurable, concrete indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll share these improvements and give an update on our collaboration with Matz and the Ruby 3 Types working group. Suitable for anyone using Ruby—no familiarity with Sorbet needed! Come follow in the footsteps of the many companies already using Sorbet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Along with Paul Tarjan, I presented a progress update at RubyKaigi 2019 in Fukuoka, Japan about what we worked on in 2018 and what we’d be working on in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk breaks down into a couple of sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief description of Stripe and what we work on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of adopting Sorbet at Stripe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The editor tools that we’ve built on top of Sorbet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our plan for what Sorbet will look like when open sourced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract of the talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a type system for Ruby at Stripe with a goal of helping developers understand code better, write code with more confidence, and detect &amp;amp; prevent significant classes of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares experience of Stripe successfully adopting Sorbet in our codebase which had millions lines of code that were written before the typechecker had been conceived. The talk will describe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the process used to add typing to existing code;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many tools developed to support this process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impact of this type system on safety and productivity at Stripe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have some exciting announcements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk does not require any previous knowledge of types and should be accessible to a broad audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A definite plus of giving this talk was getting to travel to Japan in April!&lt;/p&gt;

At work, I’d noticed that using union types in Flow incurred a creeping cost in terms of a bloated bundle size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I explore why that’s the case. We starts with a problem which union types can solve, flesh out the problem to motivate why union types are definitely the solution, then examine the resulting cost of introducing them. In the end, we compare Flow to other compile-to-JS languages on the basis of how they represent union types in the compiled output. I’m especially excited about Reason, so we talk about it the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are all computer scientists.&lt;br&gt; You know what FINITE AUTOMATA can do.&lt;br&gt; You know what TURING MACHINES can do.&lt;br&gt; For example, Finite Automata can add but not multiply.&lt;br&gt; Turing Machines can compute any computable function.&lt;br&gt; Turing machines are incredibly more powerful than Finite Automata.&lt;br&gt; Yet the only difference between a FA and a TM is that&lt;br&gt; the TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil.&lt;br&gt; Think about it.&lt;br&gt; It tells you something about the power of writing.&lt;br&gt; Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.&lt;br&gt; With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Manuel Blum, &lt;em&gt;Advice to a Beginning Graduate Student&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is a critically important skill for various reasons. Once you’ve convinced yourself &lt;em&gt;to write&lt;/em&gt;, the next question becomes &lt;em&gt;how to write&lt;/em&gt;. Writing at the Command Line introduces a handful of workflows, tools, and suggestions for writing in plain text, with a particular emphasis on Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

Towards the end of my time there, I became increasingly interested in design, specifically typography and information hierarchy. As such, for the Fall 2016 Web Dev Weekend (see also: &lt;a href=&quot;/talks//frontend-javascript-primer/&quot;&gt;Frontend JavaScript Primer&lt;/a&gt;), I held another workshop-style talk on using typography and information hierarchy titled “Crafting Well-Designed Sites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was split into two halves: a lecture portion where I introduced actionable rules for improving the design of print and digital text, followed by an interactive “design critique” where the participants sketched their ideas and we discussed what we liked and didn’t like about various designs.&lt;/p&gt;

Its central motivation is this: students who have been instructed or told to use Vim to complete programming assignments while ssh’ed are missing out on the vast power that lies within Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two fronts to having an amazing Vim experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knowing how to manipulate text using Vim’s built in keyboard shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having plugins that make Vim behave like users would expect from a modern text editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience as a TA and fellow student, learning the former requires the latter and vice versa, leading to a vicious cycle of Vim peril. With this in mind, this talk aims to cure the latter, so that the vicious cycle can end.&lt;/p&gt;
